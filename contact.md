## Contact

There are many ways to contact me, due to the nature of the web (and every site deciding that they need their own PM system). The methods in the list below is where you can contact me the best, as I don't check other sites that often.

- **Discord**: @fancyfinn9 (No Nitro gifts please!)
- **Email**: fancyfinn9@gmail.com
- **XMPP/Jabber**: fancyfinn9@conversations.im (OMEMO encryption recommended)

For XMPP with OMEMO, I only use the following keys:  
- Desktop: b25e9e32 852d5bca 99cb157c f7ebe99a 592b2f88 cffe7259 1544364a 42ab0971  
- Mobile: e498493a 631721f0 376f72e1 705e4370 564a6435 0dd44a44 0d0aeb27 67056c15
If I for some reason must use another key, I will share it using one of the keys above first.

Other platforms which I will happily communicate on, but you may need to message me using a method above first as I may have notifications turned off atm:

- **Matrix**: @fancyfinn9:matrix.org (Encryption welcome)

I primarily speak English, but any Hungarian or Italian correspondence is welcome.
