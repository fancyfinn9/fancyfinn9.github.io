The Nintendo Wii was a unique part of my childhood. It was the only console my family had until I was older, and it is still my favourite by far. Even my 3DS which I obtained recently can't quite give the same experience.

Although I have been playing a lot of Animal Crossing: New Leaf on my Nintendo 3DS, I am still quite fond of the first Animal Crossing title I have played, which is City Folk (or as we know it here in Europe, Let's Go To The City. For the sake of my fingers typing this I will use the international name in this post, though do note that I prefer the European name ;) ).

The game that I played the most on the Wii was undoubtedly Mario Kart Wii. There's no experience quite like MKW, and with 4 people being able to play together on the same console, it is hands-down one of the best games ever.\
What really made it pop, though, was the popular mod called CTGP (Custom Track Grand Prix). This mod added around 200 new tracks to the game, along with a number of other quality of life changes.\
I recently found myself wondering, what if there was a mod like this for City Folk, too? Seeing all the hate that AC:CF gets, it could be one mod like this that revives the game, besides making it a much better playing experience. Sadly there is only 1 actual mod for City Folk around the internet, which adds a number of quality of life changes, re-enables a number of features that the devs disabled (but left in the code), and adds a lot of new villagers. I felt like there could be something better than that, maybe overhauling some of the forgotten parts of the game or introducing new features entirely.

And thus I set myself the challenge of making a mod for Animal Crossing. I first plan to make some quality of life changes and explore the games code and files, and possibly later on touch into the game's code and add a few features of my own (for future reference: maybe make the player able to make their own shop in the city?!).

I will post here on my blog as I journey through this new realm of unexplored (for me, at least), and hopefully by 2026 I can state that I'm the author of the biggest Animal Crossing: City Folk mod!

A bonus of documenting this all on my blog is that I can also see what features I can add to my blog itself - for one I might look into a tags system, so readers like you can quickly browse my posts of similar topics. ;)

Happy New Year!
