Note: With my following post, I mean no offense, disrespect or anything else negative towards anyone. I am also not a theologian, so please speak with a Christian pastor, theologian, priest etc for deeper meanings of verses.

(this post was made in a hurry and will be formatted further soon)

Leviticus 18:22 NKJV
[22] You shall not lie with a male as with a woman. It is an abomination. 
> From the Old Testament, God directly commands his people to not practice homosexuality.

I Corinthians 6:9-10 NKJV
[9] Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, [...] nor homosexuals, [...] nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God. 
> Paul in his first letter to the church in Corinth, reminds the people that homosexuality is a sin, even outside of the Old Testament.

Genesis 1:27, 31 NKJV
[27] So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.

[31] Then God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was very good. [...]
>God created man and woman, two genders.
>The phrase "and it was good" (Hebrew: וַיַּרְא אֱלֹהִים כִּי־טוֹב, vayar Elohim ki-tov) appears here and pretty much after every thing God creates. "טוֹב" (tov) is typically translated as "good", but it carries a much deeper meaning. It means that something is fitting, functional, and pleasant or beautiful. This means that the perfect God thought that 2 genders was perfect, no extra genders or identifications needed.


Deuteronomy 22:5 NKJV
[5] “A woman shall not wear anything that pertains to a man, nor shall a man put on a woman’s garment, for all who do so are an abomination to the Lord your God.
> The people of God are commanded to not dress like, or imitate, the other gender.
> God made us perfect as we are. We don't need to change our looks, behaviors, or anything else. In this verse it tells us that God despises those who merely wear the opposite gender's clothes, imagine what he thinks of people who change their bodies...!

These are just some verses from the Bible, Christians' sacred book, that discourage LGBT.
