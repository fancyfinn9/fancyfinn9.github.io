## Hey there, I'm fancyfinn9

Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm a developer and musician, with a range of skills all the way from Python to the trumpet.

This site is relatively new, I'm still working on improving it. Please stand by!

### About me

Bla bla

### I prefer open-source

As a developer I love nothing more than open-source projects. It means you can view the code to see what's going on, make your own changes and customise it, and even run it yourself. It also means you don't have to work on your own, but other people can contribute to your code without being a part of your team.
I aim to keep most of my projects and work open-source for these reasons.
