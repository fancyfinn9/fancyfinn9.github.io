## Donate

<!--If you feel like my work has been helpful to you, please do consider donating! It helps me out a ton and means I can spend more time creating awesome stuff-->
We're currently accepting donations for [JMA Minetest](https://ctf.jma-sig.de), a Luanti server network at which I am a core developer.

**All funds recieved across all the donation methods for the duration of the week will be donated to JMA**

I will be holding a development stream on my Youtube and Twitch to raise funds for JMA, too. Join me on Friday!
