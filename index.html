<h4>Hey there, I'm fancyfinn9</h4>

<p>Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm a Christian, developer and musician.</p>

<p>Here on my website I host a few pages about myself, my projects, and other random stuff. Why do I do this? Well, mainly with the hopes of someone finding it useful one day, otherwise just to document stuff for myself. Also being able to link to one place from all my profiles (rather than point from everywhere to everywhere) is handy ;)</p>

<h3>$ journalctl -r</h3>

<p>I'm currently working on:<br>
1. <a href="https://github.com/Minetest-JMA-group" target="_blank">JMA Minetest</a>, particularly JMA Mineclone2 and an upcoming server<br>
2. Various arrangements on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@fancyfinn9" target="_blank">Youtube channel</a><br>
3. <s>Decompiling and writing a wiki about Animal Crossing: City Folk modding</s> Sadly I had to pause this due to my PC being out of order, but now that I've bought one I will continue soon</p>

<h3>$ echo $NOTICE</h3>

<p>This site is currently Work in Progress - while I do not have an ETA for the completion of it, it will certainly be "completed" to some degree sometime soon. Until then, please be aware that the site is incomplete and may have errors/mistakes/etc. If you find such, please let me know either by DM'ing me or by creating an issue on this site's Github repo. Thanks!</p>
