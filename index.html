<h4>Hey there, I'm fancyfinn9</h4>

Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm a developer and musician, with a range of skills all the way from Python and Lua to the trumpet.

Here on my website I host a few pages about myself, my projects, and other random stuff. Why do I do this? Well, mainly with the hopes of someone finding it useful one day, otherwise just to document stuff for myself. Also being able to link to one place from all my profiles (rather than point from everywhere to everywhere) is handy ;)
